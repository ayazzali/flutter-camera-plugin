# Flutter Camera Plugin
This is a work in progress flutter camera plugin.

Right now you are able to take a photo from flutter by launching the native android camera, and return the filepath for that photo!

It uses the Async Host Messaging system from flutter to capture the image data using androids onActivityResult callback.

iOS integration does not work at the moment

PR's are welcome however will be merged after the foundation for the plugin is stablized and the code is cleaned up
